# Day9-Cpp-DoorPrize
A Qt project to display one of three images hidden behind a door. Part of my [30-Day Programming Challenge](https://showmethecodeblog.wordpress.com/2018/10/09/whats-behind-door-number/ "What's Behind Door Number...").

**Note:** In order to get the images to display, you will need to include an absolute path or add the image to the [Qt Resource System](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/resources.html "The Qt Resource System").
